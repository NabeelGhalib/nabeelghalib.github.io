# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project involves predicting house prices using various regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge. The aim is to create accurate models that can estimate property prices based on key features, aiding in better decision-making in the real estate market.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas:** For handling and preprocessing data.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing data and model performance.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For implementing regression models and evaluating their performance.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For structuring and executing the analysis.

## Key Tasks Performed
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created and selected relevant features to improve model accuracy.
- **Modeling:** Implemented multiple regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and others, to predict house prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized models using GridSearchCV to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Visualized model performance and feature importance to better understand the results.
